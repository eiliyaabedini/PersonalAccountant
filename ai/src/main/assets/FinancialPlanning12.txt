What is a personal financial plan?
A personal financial plan is a structured approach to organizing and optimizing your finances over the long term. It records income and expenses, accounts for savings goals and potential risks and serves as a guide for financial decisions. The primary goal of a financial plan is to provide a clear overview of your financial situation and to develop personalized strategies for improving and stabilizing your finances.

Why do you need personal financial planning?
A personal financial plan helps you define and achieve financial goals such as building wealth, preparing for retirement or saving for major purchases. By consolidating all financial aspects into one overview, it offers clarity and helps you set priorities to work towards them effectively.

Personal financial planning enables you to take a comprehensive view of your financial situation. This includes balancing income and expenses, strategically reducing debt and simultaneously building financial reserves. Long-term goals like creating investments for retirement or significant purchases can be clearly defined and pursued.

A well-structured financial plan also forms the foundation for managing financial risks, such as unexpected expenses or income loss. This contributes to everyday security and helps you achieve long-term dreams and plans.

In the next steps, we’ll explore how personal financial planning can help you pay off debt, build reserves, and increase your income.

Paying off debt
Paying off debt is an important part of setting up your personal financial plan. High liabilities not only strain your budget but can also jeopardize long-term financial goals. With a clear plan and the right strategy, you can gradually reduce your debt and improve your financial situation.

Here’s how to proceed:

List all debts: note down all liabilities, including amounts, interest rates, and monthly installments

Prioritize debts: focus on liabilities with the highest interest rates to reduce interest costs

Adjust your monthly budget: plan a fixed amount for the additional repayment of your debts

Check for negotiation options: talk to creditors about options like lower interest rates or payment plans

Use additional income: use extra earnings specifically for faster repayment

As an individual, a personal financial plan supports you in monitoring your progress and staying motivated. With every loan paid off, you gain more leeway for your financial future.

Saving and building reserves
Building reserves is an essential component of personal financial planning because it creates financial security and flexibility. A financial cushion protects you from unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, a defective household appliance, or moving costs. It also gives you the opportunity to finance larger goals, such as a trip or an investment, without relying on credit. Especially in uncertain times, a reserve ensures that you can handle unforeseen situations more effectively.

To integrate saving and building reserves into your personal financial plan, a structured approach is helpful. First, set a savings goal, such as three to six months’ worth of expenses for emergencies. Then analyze your income and expenses to determine how much you can save monthly. Automated transfers to a separate account, such as a money market account, make it easier to regularly build reserves.

Through this disciplined approach, you create a financial foundation that not only provides stability but also leaves room for future investments and projects. A clear overview of your savings goals and regular monitoring of your progress further motivate you.

Increasing income
Earning more money is an effective way to strengthen your personal financial plan. Additional income helps you achieve financial goals faster. This step is especially useful if your fixed costs are already optimized and you want to create more financial flexibility.

Here’s how you can implement this step, for example:

Review side jobs: consider how you can turn your skills into an income source, such as through freelance work, tutoring, or handyman services

Part-time or temporary jobs: an additional job, even for a few hours a month, can be a reliable source of income

Build passive income: investments such as dividend stocks or renting out items can generate regular income in the long term

Monetize hobbies: creative activities like photography, writing, or art can often become an additional source of income if you offer them purposefully

Professional development: a pay raise or a better-paid job through further training or qualifications is also a way to earn more income

By purposefully tapping into additional income sources, you can set up your personal financial plan and stabilize it in the long term. It is important that these measures fit your schedule and resources so that they are sustainable and do not overwhelm you.

Step by step: how to create your personal financial plan
Creating a personal financial plan helps you organize your finances and achieve clear goals. Follow these steps to optimize your personal financial planning:

List income and expenses

Define risks and ensure their coverage

Write down personal goals

Analyze account structures

Consider wealth-building strategies

Listing income and expenses
The first step in your personal financial plan is to create a clear overview of your income and expenses. Note down all regular income, such as salary, side earnings, or government benefits. Then, list your fixed costs (e.g., rent, insurance) and variable expenses (e.g., leisure, shopping). A household budget – whether digital or on paper – can help you document your income and expenses precisely and identify savings opportunities. This overview shows how much money is available monthly.

Defining risks and ensuring their coverage
A solid financial plan accounts for financial risks, such as income loss due to unemployment or illness, as well as unforeseen expenses. Check whether your insurance policies, such as liability, disability, or health insurance, are sufficient. Additionally, you should build an emergency reserve that covers three to six months of expenses. This reserve protects you from financial bottlenecks and enables you to pursue long-term goals despite unexpected strains. Regularly reviewing your coverage ensures that your plan always matches your life situation.

Writing down personal goals
Clear goals are essential for your financial planning. Consider which short-term goals you want to achieve within a year, such as a trip or buying a new car. Long-term goals, to be realized in five or ten years, such as retirement planning or buying a property, should also be concretized. Write down these goals and prioritize them to align your financial planning accordingly.

Analyzing account structures
A well-organized account structure makes it easier to keep track of your finances and focus on your goals. A household account for fixed costs such as rent, electricity, or insurance ensures that regular payments are managed transparently. A savings account serves to build reserves, whether for emergencies or planned expenses. Additionally, you can use a brokerage account for investments like stocks or ETFs to build wealth in the long term. This clear separation helps you control spending, pursue savings goals consistently, and sustainably organize your personal financial plan.

Considering wealth-building strategies
A central part of personal financial planning is wealth building, as it ensures long-term financial security and independence. Consider which financial investments match your savings goal and time horizon, such as ETFs, stocks, real estate, or bonds. Include factors like expected returns, risks, and liquidity to adapt your investments to your personal situation. A good diversification helps to spread risks and better withstand market fluctuations. With a structured plan, you can systematically build wealth and prepare for future financial challenges or goals.

Example of a private financial plan
A private financial plan can be implemented most effectively when approached in a structured manner. To help you get started, we will show you an example of how personal financial planning might look. This will give you a clear idea of how to balance income, expenses, savings, risks, and investments.

Example of a private financial plan:

List income and expenses:
Income:
Salary: €2,800
Side income: €300
Total income: €3,100
Expenses:
Fixed costs (rent, electricity, insurance): €1,200
Variable costs (groceries, leisure, transport): €700
Total expenses: €1,900
Define risks and ensure coverage:
Emergency fund: The goal is three months of expenses (€5,700)
Monthly savings: €300 to a separate savings account
Existing insurance policies: Liability, occupational disability, health insurance (adequately covered)
Write down personal goals:
Short term (next 1–2 years): Save €2,000 for a holiday
Long term (5–10 years): Save €15,000 for a property
Analyse account structure:
Household account: For fixed costs and variable expenses
Savings account: For emergency funds and savings goals
Investment account: For long-term investments such as ETFs and individual stocks
Consider wealth accumulation:
Monthly ETF savings plan: €300 (for long-term wealth building)
Individual stock investments: €100 (risk diversification)
Total investment budget: €400
This example of a private financial plan demonstrates how to structure your finances step by step and align them with your individual goals. Adjust the amounts and categories to suit your personal situation in order to create a financial plan that best reflects your current circumstances and long-term objectives.

Frequently asked questions about personal financial planning
Here you will find answers and explanations to the most frequently asked questions about personal financial planning.

What is the difference between a household budget and a personal financial plan?
A household budget focuses on the monthly management of income and expenses to maintain short-term oversight for the household. A personal financial plan, on the other hand, is more long-term and additionally includes savings goals, reserves, wealth building, and risk management to strategically achieve financial objectives.

What are the pitfalls of personal financial planning?
The most common pitfalls of personal financial planning are:

Unrealistic goals: Setting overly ambitious savings targets or making investments without sufficient financial backing can be demotivating or lead to unnecessary financial strain.

Lack of flexibility: A rigid plan that doesn’t allow adjustments to changing life circumstances can quickly become impractical.

Ignoring risks: Without adequate reserves or insurance, unexpected events can completely derail the plan.

No regular review: If the financial plan isn’t reviewed and updated regularly, it loses relevance and utility.

Excessive complexity: A plan that is too detailed or difficult to implement can be intimidating and often remains unrealized.

When is financial planning for private households useful?
Financial planning is useful when you want to improve your financial oversight, pay off debts, save for major purchases, or pursue long-term goals like wealth building or retirement planning. It’s particularly important during life changes or in uncertain financial situations. Financial planning helps you set priorities and make better financial decisions. With a clear structure, you can also build reserves and better safeguard against potential risks.
