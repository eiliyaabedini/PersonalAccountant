Why is it worth saving money?
Saving money creates financial security and independence. A financial buffer helps cover unexpected expenses like repairs or medical costs and supports long-term goals such as travel, homeownership or retirement planning.

Starting to save early helps build financial stability, making it easier to face future challenges with confidence. It encourages more conscious spending, helps prioritise expenses, and ensures that financial goals like retirement or larger investments are achievable. In the long run, this leads to more freedom and greater planning certainty.

Before saving: getting an overview
Before you can actively save money, it’s essential to clearly understand your financial situation. Knowing your income, expenses and financial commitments helps you save effectively and avoid unnecessary costs. A structured personal financial plan forms the foundation for successful budgeting and helps you identify potential savings in your daily life.

Things to focus on before saving:

Track income
Note your monthly earnings from wages, side job, or other sources. This helps you understand exactly how much money is available.

Break down expenses
Divide your expenses into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs include rent, insurance, and subscriptions, while variable costs cover groceries, leisure activities or clothing. A household budget helps document and control all expenses.

Identify unnecessary expenses
Review your spending habits to see if any areas can be adjusted. This might include impulse purchases, unused subscriptions or high-energy-consuming devices at home.

Set savings goals
Decide how much you want to save each month and for what purpose. Clear goals motivate and help you stay consistent.

Define priorities
Ensure essential expenses are covered before saving money. Balancing saving and maintaining your quality of life is key.

By gaining an overview, you not only identify savings opportunities but also lay the groundwork for a sustainable budget. This allows you to save money in everyday life more consciously and systematically.

Our 18 tips and tricks for saving money in everyday life
Saving money doesn’t have to be complicated. Often, small changes and mindful decisions can lead to significant long-term benefits. Whether it’s budgeting, shopping or household expenses, there are many ways to optimise spending and set money aside.

Here are 18 practical tips to help organise your finances and achieve your savings goals more easily.

1. The three-account model
The three-account model is a simple yet effective method to structure your finances and save money. Your income is distributed across three separate accounts: one for fixed costs, one for leisure and variable expenses and one for savings.

Account 1: Fixed costs – Covers regular expenses like rent, utilities, insurance and subscriptions

Account 2: Leisure and variable expenses – For flexible costs like groceries, clothing or leisure activities

Account 3: Savings – For reserves and savings goals, ideally with a fixed transfer at the start of the month

The three-account model provides clear financial oversight and helps you prioritise. It not only creates financial order but also simplifies monthly savings.

2. Employer savings schemes
Employer savings schemes are an easy way to save additional money, especially if your employer supports them. Your employer contributes a fixed amount each month into a savings plan, which may also be subsidised by the government.

Use employer contributions: check if your employer offers savings schemes and the level of support

Choose a suitable plan: options include bank savings plans, building society contracts or investment funds

Check for government incentives: depending on your income, you may benefit from bonuses like the employee savings allowance

These schemes allow you to build wealth step by step without making significant cuts to your monthly budget.

3. Use a household budget for planning
A household budget is a practical tool to manage finances and save money at home. It helps you track income and expenses clearly, identifying savings opportunities.

Record income and expenses: regularly document what you earn and where your money goes

Separate fixed and variable costs: this keeps track of essential and flexible expenses

Spot areas for improvement: it’s easier to identify and reduce unnecessary or recurring costs

Whether digital or on paper, a household budget ensures transparency and helps you plan your budget better to save money long-term.

4. Save at the start of the month
One of the most effective methods to save regularly is the "pay yourself first" principle. At the start of each month, transfer a fixed amount to your savings account before making other expenditures. This ensures you meet your savings goal without realising you’ve spent the money elsewhere.

Automating this process with a standing order makes it easier. When your salary arrives, the savings amount is automatically transferred to a separate account. This turns saving into a habit and reduces the risk of unintentional spending.

For example, if you save 10% of your income and earn £2,500 net monthly, you’d transfer £250 to your savings account at the start of the month. Over a year, this builds up £3,000 in reserves.

5. Seek financial advice
Professional financial advice can be helpful in gaining a better understanding of your finances. A financial advisor or debt counsellor can analyse your income and expenses, reduce fixed costs and set personalised savings goals.

Expert advice provides tailored money-saving tips and strategies to achieve financial stability in the long run.

6. Pay off debt
Reducing debt is a critical step towards financial independence and saving money effectively. High-interest debts from loans or overdrafts strain your budget and hinder building reserves.

Start by reviewing all debts and prioritising them by interest rate. High-interest debts, such as overdrafts or credit card balances, should be paid off first. Consider consolidating debt to benefit from lower rates.

Plan regular repayments in your monthly budget and set realistic goals to gradually reduce debt. As your liabilities decrease, you’ll free up more money to save or use for your goals.

7. Annual financial check-up
A yearly financial review helps maintain oversight of your finances and identify savings opportunities.

Analyse expenses: look for ways to reduce or eliminate costs, such as switching electricity, internet or insurance contracts

Review contracts and subscriptions: cancel unused or unnecessary memberships and subscriptions

Adjust savings goals: Ensure your goals align with your current circumstances and update them as needed

8. Save on groceries
Groceries are one of the largest variable expenses, but careful planning and mindful shopping can significantly reduce costs without sacrificing quality.

Create a shopping list and stick to it to avoid impulse purchases

Use offers and discount apps for cheaper purchases

Choose seasonal produce for freshness and affordability

Stock up on non-perishables during sales and avoid food waste

Cook meals at home, which is often cheaper and healthier than ready-made options

9. File a tax return
Filing a tax return can be financially rewarding, as many taxpayers receive refunds for overpaid taxes. Expenses like commuting, training, household services, or insurance premiums can often be claimed to reduce your tax liability.

Digital tax tools or professional advisors simplify the process. The effort is typically minimal and can result in additional income at the end of the year.

10. Tips for shopping
Shopping can quickly become a source of unnecessary expenses, but a few simple tricks can help you save money effectively. Adopting a mindful approach to your shopping habits allows you to plan ahead and reduce impulse purchases.

Create a shopping list: plan what you need before heading to the supermarket and stick to your list

Don’t shop when hungry: hunger often leads to buying more than planned, especially unhealthy or expensive snacks

Compare prices: check the price differences between branded products and store brands, which are often cheaper but still of good quality

Take advantage of offers: plan your shopping around discounts and special offers without being tempted into unnecessary bulk buying

Buy in bulk sensibly: opt for larger packs only if you’ll use the quantity to avoid food waste

These tips help you stay in control while shopping, reducing expenses and freeing up more money for savings or household needs.

11. Household savings tips
There are plenty of opportunities to save money around the house by making small adjustments to your daily routine. These tips promote conscious use of resources without sacrificing comfort.

Save energy: turn off devices completely instead of leaving them on standby and use energy-saving bulbs or LED lighting

Identify energy guzzlers: regularly check high-energy-consuming appliances and consider replacing them with more efficient models to save costs over time

Reduce water use: shorten shower times, use water-saving showerheads, and turn off taps while brushing your teeth

Lower heating costs: heat only the rooms you use, keep temperatures moderate, and bleed radiators regularly to maximise efficiency

Make your own cleaning products: create cost-effective cleaners, like an all-purpose solution, from vinegar, baking soda or citric acid

12. Avoid impulse purchases
Impulse purchases are a major reason for unnecessary spending. These spur-of-the-moment decisions often happen in supermarkets or while online shopping. To avoid them, create a clear shopping list and stick to it.

For larger purchases, wait at least 24 hours before making a decision. This pause creates distance and prevents you from buying things you don’t truly need. By planning and questioning your purchases, you’ll save money in the long term and stay in control of your finances.

13. Limit exposure to advertising
Advertising can unconsciously influence spending habits, often leading to unnecessary purchases. By reducing your exposure to ads—whether in online shops, on social media, or streaming platforms—you can save money effectively.

Unsubscribe from newsletters: avoid marketing emails by unsubscribing

Disable personalised ads: adjust settings on apps and online services to reduce targeted advertising

Avoid paid ad-free subscriptions: instead of paying for ad-free services, focus on conscious consumption

Less exposure to advertising means fewer temptations, helping you focus on what you truly need and leaving more money for savings.

14. Adopt sustainable consumption
Sustainable shopping saves money while conserving resources and protecting the environment. Choosing durable, high-quality products avoids frequent replacements and reduces unnecessary expenses.

Consider if you genuinely need an item before buying or explore more sustainable alternatives

Opt for second-hand purchases, repair instead of replacing, or borrow tools and equipment you use infrequently

Sustainable consumption means thinking long term. Buying less but focusing on quality pays off over time, helping you reach your savings goals while being environmentally conscious.

15. Plan holidays early
Planning holidays well in advance can save a significant amount of money. Early bird discounts on flights, hotels and package holidays are usually cheaper than last-minute offers. Early planning also allows more time to compare prices and find the best deals.

Book months in advance and use comparison sites to find the best options

Travel off-peak: opt for times outside the high season or midweek trips to cut costs further

Explore alternatives: consider holiday rentals or hostels instead of hotels

Early planning avoids costly last-minute bookings and helps you stick to your budget while enjoying a stress-free holiday.

16. Save on transportation
You can cut travel costs by switching to more affordable alternatives. Using public transport, like buses, trains or carpooling, reduces fuel expenses, parking fees and wear on your car. For short distances, cycling or walking saves money and boosts health.

If a car is necessary, consider car-sharing to avoid the costs of owning a vehicle. Additionally, compare the prices of monthly or annual public transport tickets and avoid unnecessary trips. These steps help you stay mobile while saving money effectively.

17. Subscriptions and memberships
Subscriptions and memberships can become hidden expenses if underutilised. Reviewing them regularly helps identify what’s genuinely needed and where savings can be made.

Cancel unused subscriptions: check services like streaming platforms, gym memberships, or magazine subscriptions for usage

Use family or group plans: share costs for streaming services or other subscriptions with friends or family

Opt for flexible options: choose monthly subscriptions for infrequent use instead of long-term contracts

H3: 18. Review insurance policies
Insurance is essential, but reviewing your policies regularly can reveal opportunities to save money.

Cancel redundant or unnecessary policies: ensure you’re not paying for duplicate coverage or policies you no longer need

Compare rates: use comparison sites or seek advice from an independent broker to find cheaper policies with the same coverage

Adjust coverage: ensure your policies match your current needs and update them if necessary

What to avoid to reach your savings goals
To save money effectively and stay on track, avoid these common mistakes:

Living without a budget: without a financial plan or tracking income and expenses, saving becomes challenging

Not setting savings goals: lack of clear goals can demotivate and lead to spending savings impulsively

Accessing savings too often: establish rules for when to dip into your savings to avoid depleting your reserves

Setting unrealistic goals: overly ambitious savings targets can be discouraging and lead to giving up

Ignoring small expenses: even minor unnecessary purchases can add up and derail your progress

By avoiding these pitfalls, you can maintain steady progress and build strong financial habits.
