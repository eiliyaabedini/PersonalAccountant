What does to diversify your portfolio mean?
Diversification is a fundamental principle in modern finance, playing a central role in enhancing returns and mitigating the risks of an investment. Simply put, diversification means that an investor spreads their capital across various asset classes, markets, sectors or geographic regions to reduce the risk of losses and increase the chances of gains. This article explains what diversification is, how it works and the different types of diversification in investing.

A portfolio, in the context of financial markets, is a collection of different investments such as securities, bonds, currencies and commodities.

Due to the varying risks and opportunities of individual assets and markets, investors should not underestimate the importance of proper diversification when building a portfolio.

Diversifying a portfolio simply means spreading capital across different asset classes, sectors and regions to reduce risk.

In a diversified portfolio, losses in individual investments can be offset by stable or even rising prices in other products.

Definition: What is diversification?
Simply defined, diversification is an investment strategy where capital is allocated across various asset classes and investment opportunities. The main goal of this strategy is to minimise risk while maximising potential returns. By spreading capital, the impact of negative developments in one asset class or sector is mitigated, as other investments can continue to deliver positive returns.

Diversification and risk
Investments always carry a certain degree of risk and volatility. Volatility refers to fluctuations in the value of an investment, which can lead to short-term losses. Risk is the uncertainty about whether an investment will gain or lose value.

For a successful investment strategy, you should understand the relationship between risk and return. Higher risk can potentially offer investors higher returns, rewarding them for taking on that risk. Conversely, lower risk often comes with lower returns. The goal is to find a balance between risk and return that aligns with your individual financial goals and risk tolerance.

How does diversification work?
Diversification works by investors allocating their capital across various asset classes, sectors and geographic regions. This reduces risk, as not all funds are invested in a single asset. If one area incurs losses, gains in other areas can offset them, stabilising the overall performance of your portfolio.

How can you approach diversifying your portfolio?
To diversify your portfolio, you should include various financial products such as securities, bonds, real estate and ETFs. Also, diversify your investments within these classes, e.g., by purchasing real estate in different regions and stocks from various sectors.

First, you should research the different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, investment funds, ETFs, real estate and commodities, and select potential investments. Within each asset class, you can further spread your capital, for example, by buying stocks from different sectors and geographic markets. This strategy reduces the risk that negative developments in one area will impact your entire portfolio. At the same time, you increase the chances of benefiting from positive developments in other areas. A well-diversified portfolio could include securities from technology companies, healthcare providers, financial institutions and commodity firms, complemented by bonds of varying maturities, real estate investments in different regions, ETFs that track broad market indices and cryptocurrencies with solid growth potential.

Example of a diversified portfolio

Disclaimer: Please note that this does not constitute investment advice, but merely an example of portfolio diversification.

For a well-diversified portfolio, you could, for example, invest 40% of your capital in securities such as stocks, spread across various sectors like technology, healthcare and finance, as well as different regions like North America, Europe and Asia. A good way to diversify when investing in stocks is through stock ETFs. These are exchange-traded funds consisting of a variety of diversified stocks. The most well-known ETF is the MSCI World, which contains stocks from around 1,600 companies.

Another 30% could go into bonds of varying maturities to ensure stable interest income. Real estate investments could make up 20% of the portfolio, considering both local and international properties. The remaining 10% could be invested in cryptocurrencies, for example. This asset class can offer opportunities for high returns but is associated with higher risk. The underlying blockchain technology holds great potential for the future by enhancing transparency, security and efficiency in many areas.

What types of diversification are there?
When diversifying an investment, investors can take different approaches. The types of diversification pertain to asset classes, sectors, investment horizons and geographic location. By diversifying a portfolio across a broad range of different types, risk is spread and the chances of stable returns are increased.

Diversification by asset classes
The explanation of what diversification by asset class means is simple: by spreading your capital across different types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and cryptocurrencies, you minimise the risk from fluctuating market conditions in a single asset class.

For example, if the stock market is experiencing a downturn, stable returns from bonds or real estate can help offset the losses. Similarly, commodities and cryptocurrencies can offer additional diversification benefits, as their value is often less correlated with traditional financial markets.

Diversification by sectors
By diversifying across sectors, capital is allocated to companies from various industries. By investing evenly in firms from sectors like technology, healthcare, finance and consumer goods, you can reduce the risk of negative sector developments. At the same time, you increase the chances of benefiting from positive developments in companies from different economic sectors. If one sector faces challenges, other sectors can still provide good returns, stabilising the overall performance of the portfolio.

Diversification by investment horizon
Diversification by investment horizon involves choosing investments with different durations. Short-, medium- and long-term investments spread risk, increase liquidity and allow you to take advantage of long-term growth opportunities.

Geographic diversification
Geographic diversification involves spreading investments across different countries and regions. This reduces the risk associated with political and economic developments in a specific country and allows you to benefit from growth opportunities in various parts of the world. Investments in markets like North America, Europe and Asia can help lower volatility and mitigate risk from regional events.

What does diversification mean in the crypto space?
Diversification in the crypto space means spreading your capital across various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins, as well as different blockchain projects and applications. This approach helps minimise the risk associated with the volatility and uncertainties of individual cryptocurrencies and projects.

By investing in a variety of cryptocurrencies, you can cushion the impact of negative developments in a specific cryptocurrency and simultaneously benefit from positive developments in others. These potential developments include regulatory decisions, security vulnerabilities and technological issues, as well as advancements, increasing adoption and partnerships with major companies.

Additionally, you can invest in various blockchain projects that cover different application areas, further contributing to the diversification of your portfolio. Examples of such application areas include Decentralised Finance (DeFi), which enables financial services without traditional banks, or Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which represent digital art and collectibles. Smart contracts, which are automatically executed contracts on the blockchain, and supply chain management, which improves the tracking of products in supply chains, are also possible application areas for cryptocurrencies.
